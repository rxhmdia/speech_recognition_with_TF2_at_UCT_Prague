# Character-level DNN Model for Czech Language Speech Recognition using TensorFlow 2

A project which was given birth as a masters thesis at UCT Prague and now continues as a part of my PhD studies. 
The core concept is developing a Character-level deep neural network (DNN) based model for 
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and transcription of Czech naturally spoken language. 
Ultimately the transcription is then to be used for controlling a robotic system using natural Czech spoken language, 
utilizing keyword spotting mechanisms.

The system starts with a data transformation pipeline, which feeds
preprocessed speech data from two Czech natural speech corpuses ([PDTSC 1.0](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdtsc1.0/en/index.html) and [ORAL2013](https://wiki.korpus.cz/doku.php/en:cnk:oral2013)) into an Acoustic Model (AM).
Data Augmentation techniques, such as [SpecAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08779) are implemented into the pipeline for improving performance on testing dataset.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
